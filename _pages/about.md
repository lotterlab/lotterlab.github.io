We are an interdisciplinary research group with a goal of solving real-world problems in medicine and computational biology using AI. 
We aim to realize this impact through collaborative research along the full clinical application pipeline - from algorithm development to the science of clinical integration itself.
This research builds upon our experience in developing FDA-cleared products that have been used across millions of patients.

<u>Joining the lab</u>: We accept graduate students across Harvard and MIT. We are especially affiliated with the Harvard [BIG](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track), Harvard [Biophysics](https://biophysics.fas.harvard.edu/), and Harvard-MIT [HST](https://hst.mit.edu/) PhD programs.
